You have decided to implement your own console similar to the
standard Windows console. Your console has the following
requirements:

 * The console supports multiple buffers
 * The console supports viewports, and multiple viewports can
   be attached to the same buffer.
 * The console is completely thread-safe, so that writing to a
   single buffer can be done from multiple threads.
 * The console supports an API similar to System.Console (i.e.,
   it supports the Console.Write and WriteLine methods).

Design the API for the console. In designing the API, make sure
you take care of the following:

 * The API should be usable, i.e., standard configurations
   (such as a console with a single buffer & viewport of matching
   size) should be easy to create.
 * The API should be extensible, so that someone implementing their
   own buffer would be able to do so.
 * The API should take care of the fact that people may attempt to
   enter nonstandard or incorrect parameters (e.g., a viewport larger than the
   buffer).
* The API should take care of the fact that people may wish to
   extend or shrink buffers and vieweports at runtime. The API should
   make it possible to do this safely.
